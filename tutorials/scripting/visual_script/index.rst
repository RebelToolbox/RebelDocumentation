VisualScript
============

.. warning::

    `Godot 4.0 will remove VisualScript from core entirely. <https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-will-discontinue-visual-scripting>`__
    As a result, creating new projects using visual scripting in Godot is not recommended.
    Future Godot 4.x releases may have VisualScript reimplemented as an extension.

    While Godot 3.x will keep VisualScript supported, we recommend
    :ref:`trying out GDScript <toc-learn-scripting-gdscript>` instead,
    especially if you intend to migrate your project to Godot 4.
