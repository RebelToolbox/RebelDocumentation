Engine development
==================

Setting up a development environment
------------------------------------

To modify Godot's source code, you need to set up a development environment. Start here.

Getting started with Godot's source code
----------------------------------------

This section covers the basics that you will encounter in (almost) every source file.

Extending Godot by modifying its source code
---------------------------------------------

This section covers what you can do by modifying Godot's C++ source code.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :name: toc-devel-cpp-source-advanced

   binding_to_external_libraries
   custom_godot_servers
   custom_resource_format_loaders
   custom_audiostreams

Debugging and profiling
-----------------------

This section is about finding spots to optimize in the engine code when you need it in your project.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :name: toc-devel-cpp-debug-profiling
