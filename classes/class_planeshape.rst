PlaneShape
==========

**Inherits:** :ref:`Shape<class_Shape>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Infinite plane shape for 3D collisions.

Description
-----------

An infinite plane shape for 3D collisions. Note that the :ref:`Plane<class_Plane>`'s normal matters; anything "below" the plane will collide with it. If the ``PlaneShape`` is used in a :ref:`PhysicsBody<class_PhysicsBody>`, it will cause colliding objects placed "below" it to teleport "above" the plane.
