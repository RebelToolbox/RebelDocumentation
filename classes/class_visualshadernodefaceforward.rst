VisualShaderNodeFaceForward
===========================

**Inherits:** :ref:`VisualShaderNode<class_VisualShaderNode>` **<** :ref:`Resource<class_Resource>` **<** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Returns the vector that points in the same direction as a reference vector within the visual shader graph.

Description
-----------

Translates to ``faceforward(N, I, Nref)`` in the shader language. The function has three vector parameters: ``N``, the vector to orient, ``I``, the incident vector, and ``Nref``, the reference vector. If the dot product of ``I`` and ``Nref`` is smaller than zero the return value is ``N``. Otherwise, ``-N`` is returned.
