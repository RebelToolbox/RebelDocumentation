ResourceImporter
================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

**Inherited By:** :ref:`EditorImportPlugin<class_EditorImportPlugin>`

Base class for the implementation of core resource importers.

Description
-----------

This is the base class for the resource importers implemented in core. To implement your own resource importers using editor plugins, see :ref:`EditorImportPlugin<class_EditorImportPlugin>`.

Tutorials
---------

Enumerations
------------

.. _enum_ResourceImporter_ImportOrder:

.. _class_ResourceImporter_constant_IMPORT_ORDER_DEFAULT:

.. _class_ResourceImporter_constant_IMPORT_ORDER_SCENE:

enum **ImportOrder**:

- **IMPORT_ORDER_DEFAULT** = **0** --- The default import order.

- **IMPORT_ORDER_SCENE** = **100** --- The import order for scenes, which ensures scenes are imported *after* all other core resources such as textures. Custom importers should generally have an import order lower than ``100`` to avoid issues when importing scenes that rely on custom resources.
