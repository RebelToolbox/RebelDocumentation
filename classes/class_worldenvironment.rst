WorldEnvironment
================

**Inherits:** :ref:`Node<class_Node>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

Default environment properties for the entire scene (post-processing effects, lighting and background settings).

Description
-----------

The ``WorldEnvironment`` node is used to configure the default :ref:`Environment<class_Environment>` for the scene.

The parameters defined in the ``WorldEnvironment`` can be overridden by an :ref:`Environment<class_Environment>` node set on the current :ref:`Camera<class_Camera>`. Additionally, only one ``WorldEnvironment`` may be instanced in a given scene at a time.

The ``WorldEnvironment`` allows the user to specify default lighting parameters (e.g. ambient lighting), various post-processing effects (e.g. SSAO, DOF, Tonemapping), and how to draw the background (e.g. solid color, skybox). Usually, these are added in order to improve the realism/color balance of the scene.
