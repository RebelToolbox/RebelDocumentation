Mutex
=====

**Inherits:** :ref:`Reference<class_Reference>` **<** :ref:`Object<class_Object>`

A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion).

Description
-----------

A synchronization mutex (mutual exclusion). This is used to synchronize multiple :ref:`Thread<class_Thread>`\ s, and is equivalent to a binary :ref:`Semaphore<class_Semaphore>`. It guarantees that only one thread can ever acquire the lock at a time. A mutex can be used to protect a critical section; however, be careful to avoid deadlocks.

Method Descriptions
-------------------

.. _class_Mutex_method_lock:

- void **lock** **(** **)**

Locks this ``Mutex``, blocks until it is unlocked by the current owner.

**Note:** This function returns without blocking if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

----

.. _class_Mutex_method_try_lock:

- :ref:`Error<enum_@GlobalScope_Error>` **try_lock** **(** **)**

Tries locking this ``Mutex``, but does not block. Returns :ref:`@GlobalScope.OK<class_@GlobalScope_constant_OK>` on success, :ref:`@GlobalScope.ERR_BUSY<class_@GlobalScope_constant_ERR_BUSY>` otherwise.

**Note:** This function returns :ref:`@GlobalScope.OK<class_@GlobalScope_constant_OK>` if the thread already has ownership of the mutex.

----

.. _class_Mutex_method_unlock:

- void **unlock** **(** **)**

Unlocks this ``Mutex``, leaving it to other threads.

**Note:** If a thread called :ref:`lock<class_Mutex_method_lock>` or :ref:`try_lock<class_Mutex_method_try_lock>` multiple times while already having ownership of the mutex, it must also call :ref:`unlock<class_Mutex_method_unlock>` the same number of times in order to unlock it correctly.
