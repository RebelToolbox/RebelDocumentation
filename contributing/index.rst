- Writing or proofreading documentation.
  You can contribute both to this reference manual or the code reference.
- Improving the engine by fixing bugs, coding new features, or refining existing ones.

Class reference guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The pages below focus on the class reference.

As the reference is included in the Rebel Engine editor, its source files are part of the `Rebel Engine repository <https://github.com/RebelToolbox/RebelEngine>`_.
We use XML files to write it, so the process to contribute to the class reference differs from writing the online manual.
