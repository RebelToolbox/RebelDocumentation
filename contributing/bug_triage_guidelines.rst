Bug triage guidelines
=====================

This page describes the typical workflow of the bug triage team aka
bugsquad when handling issues and pull requests on Rebel Engine's
`GitHub repository <https://github.com/RebelToolbox/RebelEngine>`__.
It is bound to evolve together with the bugsquad, so do not
hesitate to propose modifications to the following guidelines.

Issues management
-----------------

GitHub proposes various features to manage issues:

-  Set one or several labels from a predefined list
-  Set one milestone from a predefined list
-  Keep track of the issue in the project dashboard
-  Define one contributor as "assignee" among the Rebel Engine organization members

As the Rebel Toolbox organization on GitHub currently has a restricted
number of contributors, we do not use assignees extensively for now. All
contributors are welcome to take on any issue, if relevant after mentioning
it on the issue ticket and/or discussing the best way to resolve it with
other developers.

For the time being, we do not use the project dashboard feature either.

As far as possible, we try to assign labels (and milestones, when relevant)
to both issues and pull requests.

Contributors are free to pick issues regardless of their assigned milestone;
if a fix is proposed for a bug that was not deemed urgent and thus without
milestone, it would likely still be very welcome.
