   - Recommended on mobile and Web platforms.
   - LDR rendering for greater compatibility.
   - Not all features are available. Features available only when using
     the OpenGL ES 3.0 renderer are marked *GLES3* below.

**Camera:**

- Perspective, orthographic and frustum-offset cameras.

**Physically-based rendering (built-in material features):**

- Follows the Disney PBR model.
- Supports Lambert, Lambert Wrap (half-Lambert), Oren-Nayar and Toon diffuse shading modes.
- Supports Schlick-GGX, Blinn, Phong, Toon and Disabled specular shading modes.
- Uses a roughness-metallic workflow with support for ORM textures.
- Uses horizon specular occlusion (Filament model) to improve material appearance
- Normal mapping.
- Detail mapping for the albedo and normal maps.
- Distance fade which can use alpha blending or dithering to avoid going through
  the transparent pipeline.
- Dithering can be determined on a per-pixel or per-object basis.
- *GLES3:* Parallax/relief mapping with automatic level of detail based on distance.
- *GLES3:* Sub-surface scattering and transmittance.
- *GLES3:* Refraction with support for material roughness (resulting in blurry refraction).
  On GLES2, refraction is still functional but lacks support for material roughness.
- *GLES3:* Proximity fade (soft particles).

**Real-time lighting:**

- Directional lights (sun/moon). Up to 4 per scene.
- Omnidirectional lights.
- Spot lights with adjustable cone angle and attenuation.
- Specular energy can be adjusted on a per-light basis.
- *GLES3:* Lighting is done with a single-pass forward approach.
  By default, up to 32 omni light and 32 spot lights can be displayed per mesh resource.
  If needed, this limit can be increased at the cost of increased shader compilation times and lower performance.
  GLES2 uses a multi-pass forward approach to lighting, which doesn't have a
  limit on the number of lights but is slower with many lights.

**Shadow mapping:**

- *DirectionalLight:* Orthogonal (fastest), PSSM 2-split and 4-split.
  Supports blending between splits.
- *OmniLight:* Dual paraboloid (fast) or cubemap (slower but more accurate).
  Supports colored projector textures in the form of panoramas.
- *SpotLight:* Single texture.

**Global illumination with indirect lighting:**

- Baked lightmaps (fast, but can't be updated at run-time).

   - Supports baking indirect light only or baking both direct and indirect lighting.
     The bake mode can be adjusted on a per-light basis to allow for hybrid light
     baking setups.
   - Supports lighting dynamic objects using an automatic octree-based system.
     No manual probe placement is required.
   - Lightmaps are baked on the CPU.

- *GLES3:* GI probes (slower, semi-real-time). Supports reflections.

**Reflections:**

- Fast baked reflections or slow real-time reflections using ReflectionProbe.
  Parallax box correction can optionally be enabled.
- Reflection techniques can be mixed together for greater accuracy or scalability.

- *GLES3:* Screen-space reflections.

**Sky:**

- Panorama sky (using an HDRI).
- Procedural sky.

**Fog:**

- Depth fog with an adjustable attenuation curve.
- Height fog (floor or ceiling) with adjustable attenuation.
- Support for automatic depth fog color depending on the camera direction
  (to match the sun color).
- Optional transmittance to make lights more visible in the fog.

**Particles:**

- *GLES3:* GPU-based particles with support for custom particle shaders.
- CPU-based particles.

**Post-processing:**

- Tonemapping (Linear, Reinhard, Filmic, ACES).
- *GLES3:* Automatic exposure adjustments based on viewport brightness.
- *GLES3:* Near and far depth of field.
- *GLES3:* Screen-space ambient occlusion.
- *GLES3:* Optional debanding to avoid color banding (effective when HDR rendering is enabled).
- Glow/bloom with optional bicubic upscaling and several blend modes available:
  Screen, Soft Light, Add, Replace.
- Color correction using an one-dimensional ramp.
- Brightness, contrast and saturation adjustments.

**Texture filtering:**

- Nearest, bilinear, trilinear or anisotropic filtering.

**Texture compression:**

- Lossless or lossy WebP (does not save VRAM; only reduces storage size).
- S3TC (only supported on desktop platforms).
- ETC1 (recommended when using the GLES2 renderer).
- *GLES3:* BPTC for high-quality compression (not supported on macOS).
- *GLES3:* ETC2 (not supported on macOS).

**Anti-aliasing:**

- Multi-sample antialiasing (MSAA).
- Fast approximate antialiasing (FXAA).

**Performance:**

- Occlusion culling with :ref:`rooms and portals <doc_rooms_and_portals>`.
  Supports gameplay notifications with primary and secondary visibility to
  disable AI/physics processing for nodes that don't need it.
- Real-time occluder spheres. Not as effective as rooms and portals
  (and doesn't support gameplay notifications), but easier to set up.

.. note::

    Most of the effects listed above can be adjusted for better performance or
    to further improve quality. This can be helpful when using Godot for
    offline rendering.

.. warning::

    `Godot 4.0 will remove VisualScript from core entirely. <https://godotengine.org/article/godot-4-will-discontinue-visual-scripting>`__
    As a result, creating new projects using visual scripting in Godot is not recommended.
    Future Godot 4.x releases may have VisualScript reimplemented as an extension.

    While Godot 3.x will keep VisualScript supported, we recommend
