Your first 2D game
==================

In this step-by-step tutorial series, you will create your first complete 2D
game with Godot. By the end of the series, you will have a simple yet complete
game of your own, like the image below.

You will learn how the Godot editor works, how to structure a project, and build
a 2D game.

.. note:: This project is an introduction to the Godot engine. It assumes that
          you have some programming experience already. If you're new to
          programming entirely, you should start here: :ref:`doc_scripting`.

The game is called "Dodge the Creeps!". Your character must move and avoid the
enemies for as long as possible. 

You will learn to:

- Create a complete 2D game with the Godot editor.
- Structure a simple game project.
- Move the player character and change its sprite.
- Spawn random enemies.
- Count the score.

And more.

You'll find another series where you'll create a similar game but in 3D. We
recommend you to start with this one, though.

**Why start with 2D?**

3D games are much more complex than 2D ones. It would be best if you stuck to 2D
until you understood the game development process and how to use Godot well.
